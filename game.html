<p>India or Indiana is an interactive story that was created in my second year of university for an end of the year project. The concept of the game was to make it through your unexpected trip to India by respecting all their customs to achieve a good end, if u picked the wrong choices then you would achieve a bad end. The story of the game sort of stemmed from a joke of India sounding alot like Indiana and what if a really confused traveler made that big mistake of boarding a plane meant for the wrong destination. Research was done to learn alot about Indian culture and to make the references accurate as possible. The game was made through the engine <a href="https://www.axure.com/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=axure%209&utm_campaign=%5BSG%5D%20Brand&utm_content=axure-rp&hsa_mt=e&hsa_cam=22678486&hsa_grp=68124740553&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&hsa_tgt=kwd-668417940432&hsa_src=g&hsa_ad=332489057445&hsa_acc=2641622590&hsa_kw=axure%209&gclid=CjwKCAiAy9jyBRA6EiwAeclQhOyIGYcxdypaHRppgNRW2cMnn1BSD0i5Mvp8y0px5Ld3pMiAr2LU8RoCiDgQAvD_BwE">Axure Rp 9 </a>. This expirence was incredible to me because this is the first time i worked in a team to create something i was passionate in and im grateful my team members helped make the expirence so great.

  <p>Spooky Beats is the first ever full video game i made while in university. It was created in my third year of university. The concept is simple, Doug the ghost is a rock star who has risen from the dead, after the notorius "Ghost gang" steals his guitar. Doug then takes it upon himself to dimantle the ghost gangs crime enterprise through the power of music. The team did an exeptional job of designing the characters, establishing the story and creating the gameplay. I can definitely say creating this game relit a passion of video games for me and made me want to continue using my skills and knowledge creating video games with a story. The engine we used to create Spooky Beats was the <a href = "https://unity.com/">unity </a> game engine
