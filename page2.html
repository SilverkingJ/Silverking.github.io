<p>
  The internet is the without a doubt one of the greaatedt man made invetions in history. The amount
  of entertainment, jobs and billionaires it has made is truly staggering and impressive. Websites
  like facebook created by genius Mark Zuckerburg has been responsible for connecting friends and
  families all across the world, this would be extremly difficult 100 years ago and virtually impossible
  1000 years ago. Today Mark Zuckerburg is worth over a billion dollars and hes not the only one. Kevin Systrom
  and Mike Krieger both were responsible for creating the photo sharing website Instagram, today instagram has multi
  million users and spands across the world. Again sharing photos this easily would be extremly difficult 50 years ago
  and would take a long time. So this just goes to show you that websites are neccasary to have mankind progress
  into the future. So i challenge you create the next Multi billion dollar website.
