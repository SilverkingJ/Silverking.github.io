<h4>My Mistakes In IASC 1P02</h4>
<div>
<p>
  I have made alot of mistakes in IASC 1P02, so much in fact my possibilities of passing is in question.
  One of the main mistakes was the lateness on my assignments. My mom suffers from scitzophrenia so i would
  often split time between school and Toronto, i was so confident in my skills in this class that i would put off
  work until i got back to school but i would often forget to finish it or it would be to complicated to finish in
  the time frame given. My overconfidence in myself served as my downfall. Another huge mistake i comitted was leaving
  class instead of asking Tom questions i had during the lessons, i am an extremly shy person and dont want to seem
  lost during class in front of all these brilliant students and even the Proffesor, so i would often pretend i understood fully but in reality
  i was struggling immensley at some points. All these Mistaks serve as no excuse because ultimatly its the students
  ability to ask questions and complete assignments.

<h4>What I Should've Done</h4>
<p>
  There are many solutions i couldve implemented in order to counteract these problems and they are fairly easy to
  accomplish in hindsight. One solution wouldve been to simply stay after class and ask Tom for help when everbody
  was gone. This wouldve clarifed some issues i had during lecture and given me a focus on what to study when i get
  home. Another solution was to tell the Proffesor in the beginning of the year what was going on at home and request
  a little extra time on labs and assignments. Tom is an extremly generous and lenient professor so there was always
  ways to succeed in his class you just have to ask hor help
