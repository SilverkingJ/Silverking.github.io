<h4>What Do I Hope To Accomplish With This Website?</h4>
<div>
<p>With this website i hope to showcase my love and appreciation i have for this class
and also create one of my very first websites. I hope to use this as a reference in later years
and use this site as a landmark to showcase what i know now and what i learneed throught the years.
This site has also taught me patience and that not everything will go according to plan at first,
so you should always research and ask the internet when you come into contact with problems. In this
website i will also show a very cool game i found while searching for cool features to insert into my
website, along with cool gifs and pictures of my favourite anime. This won't only serve as an
appreciation post but also as an appreciation post to the things i pride myself on being a fan of.

<h4>What Do I Hope To Accomplish In The Future??</h4>
<p>In the future i really hope to go far with website building, i want to be able to make websites that
make people excited to go to and easy to maneuver around. This is a dream of mine and the reason why i came
to university of Brock, i really hope to grow my skill in the future and hopefully be fortunate enough to run
a buissness which will be accompinied with a website i have built. I currently don't have a clue of what type
of buissness i want to run as of yet but, i do know i want it based in technology and design. I hope i accomplish
all my goals in the future and i hope you do too. I challenge you!, write yourself a letter about what you thiink
you will be doing in 5 years, and in 5 years ask yourself, Have you accomplished your goals? Have you tried your
hardest to turn your dreams into reality?
